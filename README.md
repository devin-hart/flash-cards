A simple JS flash card game

Someone posted on Reddit about designing and building a flash card game for a very low price. Curious I wanted to know how quickly I could build a flash card game, the answer? About 2 - 2.5 hours. A portion of that went to some mild design. Feel pretty good about the time.
